                <h3>About the shelter<br> "Cozy House"</h3>
                <p> Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and <br>
                    statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The <br>
                    others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky <br>
                    chance to become dearly loved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they <br>
                    do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and <br>
                    well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of <br>
                    various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the <br>
                    shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached <br>
                    to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
